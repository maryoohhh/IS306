**Information is a key business resource**

<dl>
    <dt>Information</dt>
    <dd>is a business resource that is used in every aspect of a business</dd>
    <dd>supports day-to-day operational tasks and activities</dd>
    <dd>enables the routine administration and management of he business</dd>
    <dd>supports strategic decision making and future planning</dd>
</dl>

**The relationship between information and data**

> Information is *data placed in context*.

This implies that some information is the result of the the translation of some data using some processing activity, and some communication protocol, into an agreed format that is identifiable to the user. In other words, if data has some meaning attributed to it, it becomes information.

<dl>
    <dt>Data</dt>
    <dd>found in ISO/IEC 2382-1.1993 (Information Technology -Vocabulary - Part 1: Fundamental Terms)</dd>
    <dd>states that it is a re-interpretable representation of information in a formalised manner suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing</dd>
    <dd>covers all forms of data but, importantly, includes data held in information systems used to support the activities of an organization of all levels: operational, managerial, and strategic</dd>
</dl>

**The importance of the quality of data**

>Information must be up to date, complete, sufficiently accurate for the purppose it is required, unambiguously understood, consistent, and available when it is required.

<dl>
    <dt>Good quality data</dt>
    <dd>data that is accurate, correct, consistent, complete, and up to date</dd>
    <dd>meaning must also be unambiguous</dd>
</dl>

**The common problems with data**

>Problems are generally caused by a combination of the proliferation of duplicate, and often inconsistent, occurrences of data, and the misinterpretation and misunderstanding of the data caused by the lack of a cohesive, enterprise-wide regime of data definition.

>Whenever it is possible for any item of information to be held as data more than once, there is a possibility of inconsistency.

Possible reasons for sharing information:
* when central reference data is used by independent operational units, such as product codes and product prices;
* when public domain datatypes are used and exchanged, for example when publicly available statistical data sets are to be used;
* when operational results need to be collated across several profit centres, for example to collate or compare the sales figures from stores within a supermarket chain;
* when the output from one system forms the input to another, for example the output of a forecasting systems is used by another system to determine resource and budget implications;
* when application systems performing a similar function for district autonomous units are required to harmonise their data to permit close collaboration, for example the command and control systems for the police, fire, and ambulance services need to *work together* in the event of an emergency

</dl>

**An enterprise-wide view of data**

> One of the difficulties often faced by a central team resposible for managing the data for the whole organization is bridging the gap between different departmental views. This requires patience and tact. It certainly requires authority, or access to appropriate authority, as the implementation of a solution may well involve cooperation with several managers within organization.

**Managing data is a business issue**

Special responsibilities within organization:
* The finance department has special responsibilities for managing the organization's money including the allocation of budgets, managing investments, and accounting.

* The estates department has special responsibilities for manging the building used by the organization including ensuring that the buildings meet legal requirements in respect of health and safety issues, buying, selling, and leasing of buildings and ensuring that the estate is adequately insured.
* The stores and maintenance department has special responsibilities for managing the organization's equipment including the provisions of a central purchasing function, the accounting for the equipment in use and the storage of equipment until it is required for use.
* the IT or IS department has special responsibility for data and information including the physical storage, distribution, security, backup, and archiving of data.
